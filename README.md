# CSharpRPG
## Type ```dotnet run``` and play along

CSharpRPG is a simply game to help me learn C#. Specifically, I wanted to focus on inheritance, interfaces, and singly-linked-lists.

This game is still bare-bones. There are only two players, you cannot yet choose your hero's class, and the enemies will not attack you. 

I plan on refactoring what i've got so far, and then building out more features, such as:
- the ability to choose a class
- healing spells
- and (of course) make the enemies attack.
