# CSharpRPG
### Type ```dotnet run``` and play along

I created this tiny terminal game to help me learn C#. Specifically, I wanted to focus on inheritance, interfaces, and singly-linked-lists.

This game is still bare-bones. There are only two players, you cannot yet choose your hero's class, and the enemies will not attack you.

I'd like to refactor what i've coded thus far, and then build out more features, such as:
- make the enemies attack.
- add more players
- choose a class
- healing spells
- mana/magic meter
- experience
- leveling
- error handling, testing, etc.
